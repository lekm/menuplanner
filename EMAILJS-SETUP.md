2. **Service ID** - from your email service

## 6. Add Configuration to Your App

Add this script tag to your `index.html` file, before the other script tags:

window.VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'your_service_id_here';

Replace the placeholder values with your actual IDs from steps above.

### Example 2: Feature Request Email
```
Subject: [Meal Planner] Feature Request: Add grocery list export to PDF

NEW REPORT FROM MEAL PLANNER APP
================================

Report Type: Feature Request
Subject: Add grocery list export to PDF
From: Jane Smith (jane@example.com)
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:20:00.000Z

DESCRIPTION:
------------
It would be great to export the grocery lists to PDF format so I can print them out for shopping. Currently I have to screenshot or copy-paste the list.

Suggested implementation:
- Add "Export to PDF" button next to the grocery list
- Include categorized sections (Proteins, Produce, etc.)
- Make it printer-friendly with checkboxes

This would be really helpful for offline shopping!

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"EmailJS not initialized" error:**
- Check that your User ID is correct
- Make sure the script loads before trying to send emails

**"Service or template ID not configured" error:**
- Verify your Service ID and Template ID are correct
- Check for typos in the configuration

**Emails not sending:**
- Check your EmailJS dashboard for quota limits
- Verify your email service is still connected
- Test with a simple template first

**Template variables not showing:**
- Make sure variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that variables are wrapped in double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`

### Testing Tips:

1. Start with a simple template to test the connection
2. Add variables one by one to identify issues
3. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
4. Use the EmailJS dashboard to monitor email sending

## 10. Security Notes

- The User ID and Service ID are safe to expose in frontend code
- Template ID is also safe to expose
- EmailJS handles rate limiting and spam protection
- Consider setting up domain restrictions in EmailJS settings for production

Your bug reporting system is now ready! Users can report issues directly from the app, and you'll receive detailed emails with all the technical information needed to debug problems.
